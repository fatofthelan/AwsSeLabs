Using the AWS CLI Tools Locally
-------------------------------

To use the AWS CLI tools on your local system, you'll need to install the aws-cli, if not already installed, and configure it for API access:
  - brew install awscli
  - List your S3 buckets with "aws s3 ls" (You should receive a message that it is unable to locate credentials)
  - Enter "aws configure"
  - Enter your terraform user's AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Key (from the csv you created earlier)
  - Enter us-west-2 for the region
  - Accept the default for the output format
  - Attempt "aws s3 ls" again (It should succeed now that you have configured it with valid credentials)
