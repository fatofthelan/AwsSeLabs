Automate Host configuration with “User Data”
--------------------------------------------

You can automatically configure a new EC2 Instance by taking advantage of the "User Data" feature.
The User Data field allows you to run commands or scripts.


Copy Website Template to S3
---------------------------

From your laptop, use the AWS CLI tools to copy your website's template to S3 where it can be fetched by EC2:
  - From the Lab-10/ directory, run "aws s3 cp template.html s3://tobias-BUCKETNAME1"
  - Validate the template.html file was copied successfully with "aws s3 ls s3://tobias-BUCKETNAME1"


Edit the user-data-example.txt File
-----------------------------------

Locate the Lab-10/user-data-example.txt file and edit the bucket name to reflect your actual bucket name.


Create EC2 Instance
-------------------

From the AWS Console, click EC2 and click the "Launch Instance" button and use the following settings:
  - Select "Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type"
  - Select t2.micro for the Instance Type
  - For the Instance Details (Default VPC), select "S3S3FullAccess" for the IAM Role
  - Expand "Advanced Details" and paste the command from the user-data-example.txt into the "User data" field, continue to storage
  - Accept storage defaults
  - Add a tag (Name:Lab10)
  - Select an existing security group (WebDMZ) which already allows SSH, HTTP, HTTPS
  - Review and launch, using the existing Key Pair, OregonKeyPair.


Access Web Server's Web Page
----------------------------

If all goes well, your EC2 instance should spin up, update it's OS, install the Apache web server, grab the tempate.html and
copy it over the the web root. To validate it has worked as expected:
  - From the AWS Console, EC2, click "Instances" to access the instance we just created.
    (Note the Instance State, Tag, Region, Security Group, etc.)
  - Click on Instance and copy the IPv4 Public IP.
  - Open a web browser and enter the Public IP address.
    (You should see the new web page automatically being served from your new host)


Access EC2 Instance
-------------------

From Terminal, we can SSH to the new instance using our OregonKeyPair and the Public IP address:
(Note the user for Amazon Linux is "ec2-user")
ssh -A ec2-user@52.35.108.48

(Alternatively, you can specify your key with "-i")
ssh -i ~/.aws/keypairs/OregonKeyPair.pem ec2-user@52.35.108.48


Validate EC2 Instance
---------------------

Useful Commands for checking EC2 instance is functioning properly:
  - ifconfig
  - route
  - curl -s https://www.google.com
  - curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ (Note the trailing slash)
  - curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data/ (Shows the commands passed via the User data field)
