IAC - Using Terraform to Automate EC2 Deployment
------------------------------------------------


Using Terraform to automatically deploy and configure a website in EC2:
  - If not already, install Terraform with "brew install terraform"
  - In the vars.tf file, edit the "existing_ssh_keypair" variable to reflect your EC2 key pair name
  - Enter "terraform init"
  - Enter "terraform plan"
  - If no errors, enter "yes" to proceed

When Terraform is finished it will output the URL to visit of your new website.
(Note: It may take a few minutes to become active after Terraform finishes.)

After you have finished validating your EC2 instance and website are functioning properly, you should
delete it as well as all of the other items that were created:
  - Enter "terraform destroy"
  - Enter "yes" to proceed
