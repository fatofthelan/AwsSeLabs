Automate the Creation of a Custom VPC with Public and Private Subnets Using Terraform
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Similar to what you crated in the previous two labs where we created a Custom VPC with
Pubic and Private subnets, we can fully automate this with Terraform as well as create the
EC2 hosts in the Private and Public network segments:
  - Change to the Lab-14 directory
  - Edit the vars.tf file and make any necessary changes
  - Enter "terraform init"
  - Enter "terraform apply" and "yes" to launch the AWS resource creating


Validate Routing and Security Rules
-----------------------------------

Once Terraform finishes creating the environment, you will be presented with the
Public Host's and Private Host's IP addresses. Validate access to the Public EC2
instance (Bastion Host) via SSH:
  - ssh -A ec2-user@54.202.95.184

Validate access to the Private EC2 instance via the Public (Bastion Host) via SSH:
  - ssh -A ec2-user@54.202.95.184
